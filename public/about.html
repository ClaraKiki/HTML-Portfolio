<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr/>
<p>I am Clara, a novice in the field of programming. 
  I hold a deep appreciation for programming due to its inherent capacity for continuous learning and evolution. 
  Originally hailing from Taiwan, I currently reside in Vancouver, Canada, where I find immense joy in the abundant natural landscapes, 
  characterized by picturesque mountains and serene lakes.
</p>

<p>  In my leisure moments, I find solace in various activities, such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Summer</li>
     <ol>
      <li>Swimming</li>
      <li>Camping</li>
      <li>Off roading</li>
      <li>Traveling</li>
     </ol>
    <li>Winter</li>
     <ol>
      <li>Snowboarding</li>
      <li>Snowshoeing</li>
      <li>Reading</li>
      <li>Sleeping</li>
     </ol>
  </ul>

  These pastimes not only enrich my life but also contribute to my personal growth and well-being.</p>

<p>I have a five-year-old Corgi. 
  Her endearing nature makes her, in my opinion, the most adorable canine companion in the world. 
  Together, we embark on exciting adventures and engage in the delightful pursuit of camping, 
  creating cherished memories in the great outdoors.</p>
